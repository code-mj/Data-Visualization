- Objective: To visualize historical CO2 emissions data and provide insights into climate change trends over the period from 1990 to 2020, using advanced data visualization tools.

- Dataset Description: Utilized a comprehensive dataset from the World Bank, containing historical data on CO2 emissions across various countries and regions over a 30-year period (1990-2020).

- Data Cleaning: Conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved handling missing values, correcting discrepancies, and normalizing data to prepare it for effective visualization.

- Visualization Tools: Employed Tableau and D3.js to create dynamic and interactive visualizations that effectively communicate trends and patterns in the CO2 emissions data.

- Impactful Insights: Through these visualizations, the project highlighted key insights such as the rise and fall of CO2 emissions in different regions, the correlation between industrial growth and emission levels etc. This can allow stakeholders to better understand the historical context and trends of climate change.

- Outcome: The combination of Tableau's user-friendly interface and D3.js's powerful customization capabilities provided a comprehensive platform for exploring and presenting climate change data. The project not only facilitated a deeper understanding of CO2 emissions trends but also demonstrated the power of data visualization in conveying complex environmental issues to a broad audience.

By utilizing these state-of-the-art visualization tools, the project succeeded in making the complex data on CO2 emissions more accessible and actionable, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and awareness regarding climate change.
